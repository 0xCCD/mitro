Quick-Start:


1. install deps (see browser-ext/README, mitro-core/README) [node, npm, homebrew, java]

git clone https://github.com/mitro-co/mitro-free
cd mitro-free
cd browser-ext/api
./build.sh
cd -

--> To work around a bug in our regression test, you will need to do the following two steps. This will be fixed shortly.
git clone https://github.com/mitro-co/keyczarjs

2. cd browser-ext
3. ./build.sh
4. cd ..
5. cd browser-ext/api/js/cli
6. Run all regression tests to ensure your source tree works.

./runtests.sh FAST

# Look for a 0 RVAL.


7. cd -
8. cd browser-ext/login
9. Make the browser extension

make release  
or 
make firefox-release 
or
make safari-release

Now you should have a browser extension that you can use to communicate with our servers.
